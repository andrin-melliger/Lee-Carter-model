# Lee-Carter-model
This repository provides an implementation of the Lee-Carter model for modeling and forecasting mortality rates which is based on the procedures presented in the following articles:

- Natacha Brouhns, Michel Denuit and Jeroen K. Vermunt. A Poisson log-bilinear regression approach to the construction of projected lifetables.       Insurance Mathematics & Economics, 31(3):373–393, 2002.

- Natacha Brouhns, Michel Denuit and Ingrid van Keilegom. Bootstrapping the Poisson log-bilinear model for mortality forecasting. Scandinavian Actuarial Journal, 2005(3):212–224, 2005.

This implementation was established as part of the following bachelor thesis:

Andrin Melliger. Modeling Mortality with the Lee-Carter Model. An Analysis of the Model and the Associated Conceptual Model Risk. Department of Mathematics, ETH Zurich, 2022. Supervised by Prof. Dr. Michael Koller, Prof. Dr. Mario V. Wüthrich.
